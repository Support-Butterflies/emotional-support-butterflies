“Mental health is the level of psychological well-being or an absence of mental illness. It is the state of someone who is "functioning at a satisfactory level of emotional and behavioral adjustment"

##Overview of the “Emotional Support Butterflies” project:
The “Emotional Support Butterflies” project is a website that enables users to interact with other people in real-time by clicking on a series of buttons that emit a butterfly icon onto the web browser screen. Each butterfly icon represents solidarity with essential employees. Users who visit the webpage and click on a button will see their butterfly icon float around on the page. They will also see the icon selections of other users interacting with the site at the same time. 

The purpose of this project is to encourage people who are social-distancing to visit the site and click on the buttons as a reminder to each other, and especially to essential workers, that although the streets are empty, “We Are With You.” The colors chosen for each visual were specifically selected to exude a sense of peace and tranquility in order to ensure that the display will be calming for the person viewing it or interacting with it. We envision that a healthcare care professional might open the page on their laptop and leave it running in the background while they work, all the while benefiting from the overflow of butterflies and visual expressions of gratitude from people all around the world thinking about them.

The inspiration to develop our website came from a desire to recognize and applaud the work of doctors, nurses, healthcare professionals, and essential employees working on the frontlines to alleviate the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. Experiencing such a rapid cultural shift on a global scale as we work together to combat the spread of covid-19 has been disorienting. In many cases, people are experiencing high levels of stress or anxiety as we self- isolate, re-evaluate future plans and preparations, and consider the toll on friends, family members, and ourselves. In particular, when developing our ideas, we discussed the strenuous and demanding work of healthcare professionals, who have an increased risk of contracting the virus and struggle with shortages of medical supplies in hospitals. The act of being locked away in our homes while essential employees go out every day to help our communities inspired us to design a platform where people can virtually express their gratitude. Our vision is that the simple design of our website, as well as the visuals produced through user interaction, will relax our feelings of isolation and create an atmosphere of camaraderie and support for the members of society most exposed to the virus and its impact.
